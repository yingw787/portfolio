description: Biosand filters are used in developing countries where water infrastructure is lacking. It consists of a hollow concrete tube filled with sand and gravel in order to filter precipitation into running water. Current milled steel biosand filter molds cost around $250,000. By 3D printing a mold instead and using fiberboard and wood components, I was able to cut the variable cost of such a mold down to about $250. Difficulties I discovered along the way include the need for constant lubrication, the difficulty in getting the inner mold out of the set concrete, and the delicate nature of the fasteners holding the mold together. I would improve this mold by 3D printing the entire structure and using larger steel fasteners. I discuss more about this project in my [resume] (//yingw787.github.io/resume).
