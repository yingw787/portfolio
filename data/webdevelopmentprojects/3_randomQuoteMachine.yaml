description: This application generates a random quote from a JSON object of quotes, and enables the user to auto-generate and send a Tweet with the quote. This application assisted in developing my understanding of HTML/CSS, in addition to use of third-party APIs. It can be found [here] (//yingw787.github.io/randomQuoteMachine).
